Improvements
------------

- Direct Xslt Transforms of the xmlfiles (-T?)
  - Need to specify transform file and output directory and/or extension
  - Default directory to be base file of transform file and default extension to be from output type of transform
    - xml, html, txt, ...?
  - also possibly with SAX events generation rather than direct XML tree


Nice to have (possibly)
-----------------------
- optionally case sensitive flag codes
