Improvements
------------

- Direct Xslt Transforms of the xmlfiles (-T?)
  - Need to specify transform file and output directory and/or extension
  - Default directory to be base file of transform file and default extension to be from output type of transform
    - xml, html, txt, ...?
  - also possibly with SAX events generation rather than direct XML tree
- Extend XML and Defines file generation to allow specification of generated extension as well as base directory
  - probably "dir,extn" with default extn and dir and comma only required when setting extn
    eg: if defaults are "Define,def" then "Def" -> "Def,def" and ",df" -> "Define,df"


Nice to have (possibly)
-----------------------
- optionally case sensitive flag codes
