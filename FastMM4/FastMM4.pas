 Fast Memory Manager 4.991

 Description:
 A fast replacement memory manager for Embarcadero Delphi Win32 applications
 that scales well under multi-threaded usage, is not prone to memory
 fragmentation, and supports shared memory without the use of external .DLL
 files.

 Homepage:
 http://fastmm.sourceforge.net

 Advantages:
 - Fast
 - Low overhead. FastMM is designed for an average of 5% and maximum of 10%
 overhead per block.
 - Supports up to 3GB of user mode address space under Windows 32-bit and 4GB
 under Windows 64-bit. Add the "$SetPEFlags $20" option (in curly braces)
 to your .dpr to enable this.
 - Highly aligned memory blocks. Can be configured for either 8-byte or 16-byte
 alignment.
 - Good scaling under multi-threaded applications
 - Intelligent reallocations. Avoids slow memory move operations through
 not performing unneccesary downsizes and by having a minimum percentage
 block size growth factor when an in-place block upsize is not possible.
 - Resistant to address space fragmentation
 - No external DLL required when sharing memory between the application and
 external libraries (provided both use this memory manager)
 - Optionally reports memory leaks on program shutdown. (This check can be set
 to be performed only if Delphi is currently running on the machine, so end
 users won't be bothered by the error message.)
 - Supports Delphi 4 (or later), C++ Builder 4 (or later), Kylix 3.

 Usage:
 Delphi:
 Place this unit as the very first unit under the "uses" section in your
 project's .dpr file. When sharing memory between an application and a DLL
 (e.g. when passing a long string or dynamic array to a DLL function), both the
 main application and the DLL must be compiled using this memory manager (with
 the required conditional defines set). There are some conditional defines
 (inside FastMM4Options.inc) that may be used to tweak the memory manager. To
 enable support for a user mode address space greater than 2GB you will have to
 use the EditBin* tool to set the LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE flag in the EXE header.
 This informs Windows x64 or Windows 32-bit (with the /3GB option set) that the
 application supports an address space larger than 2GB (up to 4GB). In Delphi 6
 and later you can also specify this flag through the compiler directive
 {$SetPEFlags $20}
 *The EditBin tool ships with the MS Visual C compiler.
 C++ Builder 6:
 Refer to the instructions inside FastMM4BCB.cpp.

 Change log:
 Version 1.00 (28 June 2004):
 - First version (called PSDMemoryManager). Based on RecyclerMM (free block
 stack approach) by Eric Grange.
 Version 2.00 (3 November 2004):
 - Complete redesign and rewrite from scratch. Name changed to FastMM to
 reflect this fact. Uses a linked-list approach. Is faster, has less memory
 overhead, and will now catch most bad pointers on FreeMem calls.
 Version 3.00 (1 March 2005):
 - Another rewrite. Reduced the memory overhead by: (a) not having a separate
 memory area for the linked list of free blocks (uses space inside free
 blocks themselves) (b) batch managers are allocated as part of chunks (c)
 block size lookup table size reduced. This should make FastMM more CPU
 cache friendly.
 Version 4.00 (7 June 2005):
 - Yet another rewrite. FastMM4 is in fact three memory managers in one: Small
 blocks (up to a few KB) are managed through the binning model in the same
 way as previous versions, medium blocks (from a few KB up to approximately
 256K) are allocated in a linked-list fashion, and large blocks are grabbed
 directly from the system through VirtualAlloc. This 3-layered design allows
 very fast operation with the most frequently used block sizes (small
 blocks), while also minimizing fragmentation and imparting significant
 overhead savings with blocks larger than a few KB.
 Version 4.01 (8 June 2005):
 - Added the options "RequireDebugInfoForLeakReporting" and
 "RequireIDEPresenceForLeakReporting" as suggested by Pierre Y.
 - Fixed the "DelphiIsRunning" function not working under Delphi 5, and
 consequently no leak checking. (Reported by Anders Isaksson and Greg.)
 Version 4.02 (8 June 2005):
 - Fixed the compilation error when both the "AssumeMultiThreaded" and
 "CheckHeapForCorruption options were set. (Reported by Francois Malan.)
 Version 4.03 (9 June 2005):
 - Added descriptive error messages when FastMM4 cannot be installed because
 another MM has already been installed or memory has already been allocated.
 Version 4.04 (13 June 2005):
 - Added a small fixed offset to the size of medium blocks (previously always
 exact multiples of 256 bytes). This makes performance problems due to CPU
 cache associativity limitations much less likely. (Reported by Craig
 Peterson.)
 Version 4.05 (17 June 2005):
 - Added the Align16Bytes option. Disable this option to drop the 16 byte
 alignment restriction and reduce alignment to 8 bytes for the smallest
 block sizes. Disabling Align16Bytes should lower memory consumption at the
 cost of complicating the use of aligned SSE move instructions. (Suggested
 by Craig Peterson.)
 - Added a support unit for C++ Builder 6 - Add FastMM4BCB.cpp and
 FastMM4.pas to your BCB project to use FastMM instead of the RTL MM. Memory
 leak checking is not supported because (unfortunately) once an MM is
 installed under BCB you cannot uninstall it... at least not without
 modifying the RTL code in exit.c or patching the RTL code runtime. (Thanks
 to Jarek Karciarz, Vladimir Ulchenko and Bob Gonder.)
 Version 4.06 (22 June 2005):
 - Displays the class of all leaked objects on the memory leak report and also
 tries to identify leaked long strings. Previously it only displayed the
 sizes of all leaked blocks. (Suggested by Ben Taylor.)
 - Added support for displaying the sizes of medium and large block memory
 leaks. Previously it only displayed details for small block leaks.
 Version 4.07 (22 June 2005):
 - Fixed the detection of the class of leaked objects not working under
 Windows 98/Me.
 Version 4.08 (27 June 2005):
 - Added a BorlndMM.dpr project to allow you to build a borlndmm.dll that uses
 FastMM4 instead of the default memory manager. You may replace the old
 DLL in the Delphi \Bin directory to make the IDE use this memory manager
 instead.
 Version 4.09 (30 June 2005):
 - Included a patch fix for the bug affecting replacement borlndmm.dll files
 with Delphi 2005 (QC#14007). Compile the patch, close Delphi, and run it
 once to patch your vclide90.bpl. You will now be able to use the
 replacement borlndmm.dll to speed up the Delphi 2005 IDE as well.
 Version 4.10 (7 July 2005):
 - Due to QC#14070 ("Delphi IDE attempts to free memory after the shutdown
 code of borlndmm.dll has been called"), FastMM cannot be uninstalled
 safely when used inside a replacement borlndmm.dll for the IDE. Added a
 conditional define "NeverUninstall" for this purpose.
 - Added the "FullDebugMode" option to pad all blocks with a header and footer
 to help you catch memory overwrite bugs in your applications. All blocks
 returned to freemem are also zeroed out to help catch bugs involving the
 use of previously freed blocks. Also catches attempts at calling virtual
 methods of freed objects provided the block in question has not been reused
 since the object was freed. Displays stack traces on error to aid debugging.
 - Added the "LogErrorsToFile" option to log all errors to a text file in the
 same folder as the application.
 - Added the "ManualLeakReportingControl" option (suggested by Nahan Hyn) to
 enable control over whether the memory leak report should be done or not
 via a global variable.
 Version 4.11 (7 July 2005):
 - Fixed a compilation error under Delphi 2005 due to QC#10922. (Thanks to Joe
 Bain and Leonel Togniolli.)
 - Fixed leaked object classes not displaying in the leak report in
 "FullDebugMode".
 Version 4.12 (8 July 2005):
 - Moved all the string constants to one place to make it easier to do
 translations into other languages. (Thanks to Robert Marquardt.)
 - Added support for Kylix. Some functionality is currently missing: No
 support for detecting the object class on leaks and also no MM sharing.
 (Thanks to Simon Kissel and Fikret Hasovic).
 Version 4.13 (11 July 2005):
 - Added the FastMM_DebugInfo.dll support library to display debug info for
 stack traces.
 - Stack traces for the memory leak report is now logged to the log file in
 "FullDebugMode".
 Version 4.14 (14 July 2005):
 - Fixed string leaks not being detected as such in "FullDebugMode". (Thanks
 to Leonel Togniolli.)
 - Fixed the compilation error in "FullDebugMode" when "LogErrorsToFile" is
 not set. (Thanks to Leonel Togniolli.)
 - Added a "Release" option to allow the grouping of various options and to
 make it easier to make debug and release builds. (Thanks to Alexander
 Tabakov.)
 - Added a "HideMemoryLeakHintMessage" option to not display the hint below
 the memory leak message. (Thanks to Alexander Tabakov.)
 - Changed the fill character for "FullDebugMode" from zero to $80 to be able
 to differentiate between invalid memory accesses using nil pointers to
 invalid memory accesses using fields of freed objects. FastMM tries to
 reserve the 64K block starting at $80800000 at startup to ensure that an
 A/V will occur when this block is accessed. (Thanks to Alexander Tabakov.)
 - Fixed some compiler warnings. (Thanks to M. Skloff)
 - Fixed some display bugs in the memory leak report. (Thanks to Leonel
 Togniolli.)
 - Added a "LogMemoryLeakDetailToFile" option. Some applications leak a lot of
 memory and can make the log file grow very large very quickly.
 - Added the option to use madExcept instead of the JCL Debug library in the
 debug info support DLL. (Thanks to Martin Aignesberger.)
 - Added procedures "GetMemoryManagerState" and "GetMemoryMap" to retrieve
 statistics about the current state of the memory manager and memory pool.
 (A usage tracker form together with a demo is also available.)
 Version 4.15 (14 July 2005):
 - Fixed a false 4GB(!) memory leak reported in some instances.
 Version 4.16 (15 July 2005):
 - Added the "CatchUseOfFreedInterfaces" option to catch the use of interfaces
 of freed objects. This option is not compatible with checking that a freed
 block has not been modified, so enable this option only when hunting an
 invalid interface reference. (Only relevant if "FullDebugMode" is set.)
 - During shutdown FastMM now checks that all free blocks have not been
 modified since being freed. (Only when "FullDebugMode" is set and
 "CatchUseOfFreedInterfaces" is disabled.)
 Version 4.17 (15 July 2005):
 - Added the AddExpectedMemoryLeaks and RemoveExpectedMemoryLeaks procedures to
 register/unregister expected leaks, thus preventing the leak report from
 displaying if only expected leaks occurred. (Thanks to Diederik and Dennis
 Passmore for the suggestion.) (Note: these functions were renamed in later
 versions.)
 - Fixed the "LogMemoryLeakDetailToFile" not logging memory leak detail to file
 as it is supposed to. (Thanks to Leonel Togniolli.)
 Version 4.18 (18 July 2005):
 - Fixed some issues when range checking or complete boolean evaluation is
 switched on. (Thanks to Dario Tiraboschi and Mark Gebauer.)
 - Added the "OutputInstallUninstallDebugString" option to display a message when
 FastMM is installed or uninstalled. (Thanks to Hanspeter Widmer.)
 - Moved the options to a separate include file. (Thanks to Hanspeter Widmer.)
 - Moved message strings to a separate file for easy translation.
 Version 4.19 (19 July 2005):
 - Fixed Kylix support that was broken in 4.14.
 Version 4.20 (20 July 2005):
 - Fixed a false memory overwrite report at shutdown in "FullDebugMode". If you
 consistently got a "Block Header Has Been Corrupted" error message during
 shutdown at address $xxxx0070 then it was probably a false alarm. (Thanks to
 Theo Carr-Brion and Hanspeter Widmer.}
 Version 4.21 (27 July 2005):
 - Minor change to the block header flags to make it possible to immediately
 tell whether a medium block is being used as a small block pool or not.
 (Simplifies the leak checking and status reporting code.)
 - Expanded the functionality around the management of expected memory leaks.
 - Added the "ClearLogFileOnStartup" option. Deletes the log file during
 initialization. (Thanks to M. Skloff.)
 - Changed "OutputInstallUninstallDebugString" to use OutputDebugString instead
 of MessageBox. (Thanks to Hanspeter Widmer.)
 Version 4.22 (1 August 2005):
 - Added a FastAllocMem function that avoids an unnecessary FillChar call with
 large blocks.
 - Changed large block resizing behavior to be a bit more conservative. Large
 blocks will be downsized if the new size is less than half of the old size
 (the threshold was a quarter previously).
 Version 4.23 (6 August 2005):
 - Fixed BCB6 support (Thanks to Omar Zelaya).
 - Renamed "OutputInstallUninstallDebugString" to "UseOutputDebugString", and
 added debug string output on memory leak or error detection.
 Version 4.24 (11 August 2005):
 - Added the "NoMessageBoxes" option to suppress the display of message boxes,
 which is useful for services that should not be interrupted. (Thanks to Dan
 Miser).
 - Changed the stack trace code to return the line number of the caller and not
 the line number of the return address. (Thanks to Dan Miser).
 Version 4.25 (15 August 2005):
 - Fixed GetMemoryLeakType not detecting expected leaks registered by class
 when in "FullDebugMode". (Thanks to Arjen de Ruijter).
 Version 4.26 (18 August 2005):
 - Added a "UseRuntimePackages" option that allows FastMM to be used in a main
 application together with DLLs that all use runtime packages. (Thanks to
 Aleksander Oven.)
 Version 4.27 (24 August 2005):
 - Fixed a bug that sometimes caused the leak report to be shown even though all
 leaks were registered as expected leaks. (Thanks to Kristofer Skaug.)
 Version 4.29 (30 September 2005):
 - Added the "RequireDebuggerPresenceForLeakReporting" option to only display
 the leak report if the application is run inside the IDE. (Thanks to G�nther
 Schoch.)
 - Added the "ForceMMX" option, which when disabled will check the CPU for
 MMX compatibility before using MMX. (Thanks to Jan Schl�ter.)
 - Added the module name to the title of error dialogs to more easily identify
 which application caused the error. (Thanks to Kristofer Skaug.)
 - Added an ASCII dump to the "FullDebugMode" memory dumps. (Thanks to Hallvard
 Vassbotn.)
 - Added the option "HideExpectedLeaksRegisteredByPointer" to suppress the
 display and logging of expected memory leaks that were registered by pointer.
 (Thanks to Dan Miser.) Leaks registered by size or class are often ambiguous,
 so these expected leaks are always logged to file (in FullDebugMode) and are
 never hidden from the leak display (only displayed if there is at least one
 unexpected leak).
 - Added a procedure "GetRegisteredMemoryLeaks" to return a list of all
 registered memory leaks. (Thanks to Dan Miser.)
 - Added the "RawStackTraces" option to perform "raw" stack traces, negating
 the need for stack frames. This will usually result in more complete stack
 traces in FullDebugMode error reports, but it is significantly slower.
 (Thanks to Hallvard Vassbotn, Dan Miser and the JCL team.)
 Version 4.31 (2 October 2005):
 - Fixed the crash bug when both "RawStackTraces" and "FullDebugMode" were
 enabled. (Thanks to Dan Miser and Mark Edington.)
 Version 4.33 (6 October 2005):
 - Added a header corruption check to all memory blocks that are identified as
 leaks in FullDebugMode. This allows better differentiation between memory
 pool corruption bugs and actual memory leaks.
 - Fixed the stack overflow bug when using "RawStackTraces".
 Version 4.35 (6 October 2005):
 - Fixed a compilation error when the "NoMessageBoxes" option is set. (Thanks
 to Paul Ishenin.)
 - Before performing a "raw" stack trace, FastMM now checks whether exception
 handling is in place. If exception handling is not in place FastMM falls
 back to stack frame tracing. (Exception handling is required to handle the
 possible A/Vs when reading invalid call addresses. Exception handling is
 usually always available except when SysUtils hasn't been initialized yet or
 after SysUtils has been finalized.)
 Version 4.37 (8 October 2005):
 - Fixed the missing call stack trace entry issue when dynamically loading DLLs.
 (Thanks to Paul Ishenin.)
 Version 4.39 (12 October 2005):
 - Restored the performance with "RawStackTraces" enabled back to the level it
 was in 4.35.
 - Fixed the stack overflow error when using "RawStackTraces" that I thought I
 had fixed in 4.31, but unfortunately didn't. (Thanks to Craig Peterson.)
 Version 4.40 (13 October 2005):
 - Improved "RawStackTraces" to have less incorrect extra entries. (Thanks to
 Craig Peterson.)
 - Added the Russian (by Paul Ishenin) and Afrikaans translations of
 FastMM4Messages.pas.
 Version 4.42 (13 October 2005):
 - Fixed the compilation error when "CatchUseOfFreedInterfaces" is enabled.
 (Thanks to Cristian Nicola.)
 Version 4.44 (25 October 2005):
 - Implemented a FastGetHeapStatus function in analogy with GetHeapStatus.
 (Suggested by Cristian Nicola.)
 - Shifted more of the stack trace code over to the support dll to allow third
 party vendors to make available their own stack tracing and stack trace
 logging facilities.
 - Mathias Rauen (madshi) improved the support for madExcept in the debug info
 support DLL. Thanks!
 - Added support for BCB5. (Thanks to Roddy Pratt.)
 - Added the Czech translation by Rene Mihula.
 - Added the "DetectMMOperationsAfterUninstall" option. This will catch
 attempts to use the MM after FastMM has been uninstalled, and is useful for
 debugging.
 Version 4.46 (26 October 2005):
 - Renamed FastMM_DebugInfo.dll to FastMM_FullDebugMode.dll and made the
 dependency on this library a static one. This solves a DLL unload order
 problem when using FullDebugMode together with the replacement
 borlndmm.dll. (Thanks to Bart van der Werf.)
 - Added the Polish translation by Artur Redzko.
 Version 4.48 (10 November 2005):
 - Fixed class detection for objects leaked in dynamically loaded DLLs that
 were relocated.
 - Fabio Dell'Aria implemented support for EurekaLog in the FullDebugMode
 support DLL. Thanks!
 - Added the Spanish translation by JRG ("The Delphi Guy").
 Version 4.49 (10 November 2005):
 - Implemented support for installing replacement AllocMem and leak
 registration mechanisms for Delphi/BCB versions that support it.
 - Added support for Delphi 4. (Thanks to Justus Janssen.)
 Version 4.50 (5 December 2005):
 - Renamed the ReportMemoryLeaks global variable to ReportMemoryLeaksOnShutdown
 to be more consistent with the Delphi 2006 memory manager.
 - Improved the handling of large blocks. Large blocks can now consist of
 several consecutive segments allocated through VirtualAlloc. This
 significantly improves speed when frequently resizing large blocks, since
 these blocks can now often be upsized in-place.
 Version 4.52 (7 December 2005):
 - Fixed the compilation error with Delphi 5. (Thanks to Vadim Lopushansky and
 Charles Vinal for reporting the error.)
 Version 4.54 (15 December 2005):
 - Added the Brazilian Portuguese translation by Johni Jeferson Capeletto.
 - Fixed the compilation error with BCB6. (Thanks to Kurt Fitzner.)
 Version 4.56 (20 December 2005):
 - Fixed the Kylix compilation problem. (Thanks to Michal Niklas.)
 Version 4.58 (1 February 2006):
 - Added the German translations by Thomas Speck and Uwe Queisser.
 - Added the Indonesian translation by Zaenal Mutaqin.
 - Added the Portuguese translation by Carlos Macao.
 Version 4.60 (21 February 2006):
 - Fixed a performance issue due to an unnecessary block move operation when
 allocating a block in the range 1261-1372 bytes and then reallocating it in
 the range 1373-1429 bytes twice. (Thanks to Michael Winter.)
 - Added the Belarussian translation by dzmitry[li].
 - Added the updated Spanish translation by Marcelo Montenegro.
 - Added a new option "EnableSharingWithDefaultMM". This option allows FastMM
 to be shared with the default MM of Delphi 2006. It is on by default, but
 MM sharing has to be enabled otherwise it has no effect (refer to the
 documentation for the "ShareMM" and "AttemptToUseSharedMM" options).
 Version 4.62 (22 February 2006):
 - Fixed a possible read access violation in the MoveX16LP routine when the
 UseCustomVariableSizeMoveRoutines option is enabled. (Thanks to Jud Cole for
 some great detective work in finding this bug.)
 - Improved the downsizing behaviour of medium blocks to better correlate with
 the reallocation behaviour of small blocks. This change reduces the number
 of transitions between small and medium block types when reallocating blocks
 in the 0.7K to 2.6K range. It cuts down on the number of memory move
 operations and improves performance.
 Version 4.64 (31 March 2006):
 - Added the following functions for use with FullDebugMode (and added the
 exports to the replacement BorlndMM.dll): SetMMLogFileName,
 GetCurrentAllocationGroup, PushAllocationGroup, PopAllocationGroup and
 LogAllocatedBlocksToFile. The purpose of these functions are to allow you to
 identify and log related memory leaks while your application is still
 running.
 - Fixed a bug in the memory manager sharing mechanism affecting Windows
 95/98/ME. (Thanks to Zdenek Vasku.)
 Version 4.66 (9 May 2006):
 - Added a hint comment in this file so that FastMM4Messages.pas will also be
 backed up by GExperts. (Thanks to RB Winston.)
 - Fixed a bug affecting large address space (> 2GB) support under
 FullDebugMode. (Thanks to Thomas Schulz.)
 Version 4.68 (3 July 2006):
 - Added the Italian translation by Luigi Sandon.
 - If FastMM is used inside a DLL it will now use the name of the DLL as base
 for the log file name. (Previously it always used the name of the main
 application executable file.)
 - Fixed a rare A/V when both the FullDebugMode and RawStackTraces options were
 enabled. (Thanks to Primoz Gabrijelcic.)
 - Added the "NeverSleepOnThreadContention" option. This option may improve
 performance if the ratio of the the number of active threads to the number
 of CPU cores is low (typically < 2). This option is only useful for 4+ CPU
 systems, it almost always hurts performance on single and dual CPU systems.
 (Thanks to Werner Bochtler and Markus Beth.)
 Version 4.70 (4 August 2006):
 - Added the Simplified Chinese translation by JiYuan Xie.
 - Added the updated Russian as well as the Ukrainian translation by Andrey
 Shtukaturov.
 - Fixed two bugs in the leak class detection code that would sometimes fail
 to detect the class of leaked objects and strings, and report them as
 'unknown'. (Thanks to Dimitry Timokhov)
 Version 4.72 (24 September 2006):
 - Fixed a bug that caused AllocMem to not clear blocks > 256K in
 FullDebugMode. (Thanks to Paulo Moreno.)
 Version 4.74 (9 November 2006):
 - Fixed a bug in the segmented large block functionality that could lead to
 an application freeze when upsizing blocks greater than 256K in a
 multithreaded application (one of those "what the heck was I thinking?"
 type bugs).
 Version 4.76 (12 January 2007):
 - Changed the RawStackTraces code in the FullDebugMode DLL
 to prevent it from modifying the Windows "GetLastError" error code.
 (Thanks to Primoz Gabrijelcic.)
 - Fixed a threading issue when the "CheckHeapForCorruption" option was
 enabled, but the "FullDebugMode" option was disabled. (Thanks to Primoz
 Gabrijelcic.)
 - Removed some unnecessary startup code when the MM sharing mechanism is
 disabled. (Thanks to Vladimir Bochkarev.)
 - In FullDebugMode leaked blocks would sometimes be reported as belonging to
 the class "TFreedObject" if they were allocated but never used. Such blocks
 will now be reported as "unknown". (Thanks to Francois Malan.)
 - In recent versions the replacement borlndmm.dll created a log file (when
 enabled) that used the "borlndmm" prefix instead of the application name.
 It is now fixed to use the application name, however if FastMM is used
 inside other DLLs the name of those DLLs will be used. (Thanks to Bart van
 der Werf.)
 - Added a "FastMMVersion" constant. (Suggested by Loris Luise.)
 - Fixed an issue with error message boxes not displaying under certain
 configurations. (Thanks to J.W. de Bokx.)
 - FastMM will now display only one error message at a time. If many errors
 occur in quick succession, only the first error will be shown (but all will
 be logged). This avoids a stack overflow with badly misbehaved programs.
 (Thanks to Bart van der Werf.)
 - Added a LoadDebugDLLDynamically option to be used in conjunction with
 FullDebugMode. In this mode FastMM_FullDebugMode.dll is loaded dynamically.
 If the DLL cannot be found, stack traces will not be available. (Thanks to
 Rene Mihula.)
 Version 4.78 (1 March 2007):
 - The MB_DEFAULT_DESKTOP_ONLY constant that is used when displaying messages
 boxes since 4.76 is not defined under Kylix, and the source would thus not
 compile. That constant is now defined. (Thanks to Werner Bochtler.)
 - Moved the medium block locking code that was duplicated in several places
 to a subroutine to reduce code size. (Thanks to Hallvard Vassbotn.)
 - Fixed a bug in the leak registration code that sometimes caused registered
 leaks to be reported erroneously. (Thanks to Primoz Gabrijelcic.)
 - Added the NoDebugInfo option (on by default) that suppresses the generation
 of debug info for the FastMM4.pas unit. This will prevent the integrated
 debugger from stepping into the memory manager. (Thanks to Primoz
 Gabrijelcic.)
 - Increased the default stack trace depth in FullDebugMode from 9 to 10 to
 ensure that the Align16Bytes setting works in FullDebugMode. (Thanks to
 Igor Lindunen.)
 - Updated the Czech translation. (Thanks to Rene Mihula.)
 Version 4.84 (7 July 2008):
 - Added the Romanian translation. (Thanks to Ionut Muntean.)
 - Optimized the GetMemoryMap procedure to improve speed.
 - Added the GetMemoryManagerUsageSummary function that returns a summary of
 the GetMemoryManagerState call. (Thanks to Hallvard Vassbotn.)
 - Added the French translation. (Thanks to Florent Ouchet.)
 - Added the "AlwaysAllocateTopDown" FullDebugMode option to help with
 catching bad pointer arithmetic code in an address space > 2GB. This option
 is enabled by default.
 - Added the "InstallOnlyIfRunningInIDE" option. Enable this option to
 only install FastMM as the memory manager when the application is run
 inside the Delphi IDE. This is useful when you want to deploy the same EXE
 that you use for testing, but only want the debugging features active on
 development machines. When this option is enabled and the application is
 not being run inside the IDE, then the default Delphi memory manager will
 be used (which, since Delphi 2006, is FastMM without FullDebugMode.) This
 option is off by default.
 - Added the "FullDebugModeInIDE" option. This is a convenient shorthand for
 enabling FullDebugMode, InstallOnlyIfRunningInIDE and
 LoadDebugDLLDynamically. This causes FastMM to be used in FullDebugMode
 when the application is being debugged on development machines, and the
 default memory manager when the same executable is deployed. This allows
 the debugging and deployment of an application without having to compile
 separate executables. This option is off by default.
 - Added a ScanMemoryPoolForCorruptions procedure that checks the entire
 memory pool for corruptions and raises an exception if one is found. It can
 be called at any time, but is only available in FullDebugMode. (Thanks to
 Marcus M�nnig.)
 - Added a global variable "FullDebugModeScanMemoryPoolBeforeEveryOperation".
 When this variable is set to true and FullDebugMode is enabled, then the
 entire memory pool is checked for consistency before every GetMem, FreeMem
 and ReallocMem operation. An "Out of Memory" error is raised if a
 corruption is found (and this variable is set to false to prevent recursive
 errors). This obviously incurs a massive performance hit, so enable it only
 when hunting for elusive memory corruption bugs. (Thanks to Marcus M�nnig.)
 - Fixed a bug in AllocMem that caused the FPU stack to be shifted by one
 position.
 - Changed the default for option "EnableMMX" to false, since using MMX may
 cause unexpected behaviour in code that passes parameters on the FPU stack
 (like some "compiler magic" routines, e.g. VarFromReal).
 - Removed the "EnableSharingWithDefaultMM" option. This is now the default
 behaviour and cannot be disabled. (FastMM will always try to share memory
 managers between itself and the default memory manager when memory manager
 sharing is enabled.)
 - Introduced a new memory manager sharing mechanism based on memory mapped
 files. This solves compatibility issues with console and service
 applications. This sharing mechanism currently runs in parallel with the
 old mechanism, but the old mechanism can be disabled by undefining
 "EnableBackwardCompatibleMMSharing" in FastMM4Options.inc.
 - Fixed the recursive call error when the EnableMemoryLeakReporting option
 is disabled and an attempt is made to register a memory leak under Delphi
 2006 or later. (Thanks to Thomas Schulz.)
 - Added a global variable "SuppressMessageBoxes" to enable or disable
 messageboxes at runtime. (Thanks to Craig Peterson.)
 - Added the leak reporting code for C++ Builder, as well as various other
 C++ Builder bits written by JiYuan Xie. (Thank you!)
 - Added the new Usage Tracker written by Hanspeter Widmer. (Thank you!)
 Version 4.86 (31 July 2008):
 - Tweaked the string detection algorithm somewhat to be less strict, and
 allow non-class leaks to be more often categorized as strings.
 - Fixed a compilation error under Delphi 5.
 - Made LogAllocatedBlocksToFile and ScanMemoryPoolForCorruptions thread
 safe. (Thanks to Francois Piette.)
 Version 4.88 (13 August 2008):
 - Fixed compiler warnings in NoOpRegisterExpectedMemoryLeak and
 NoOpUnRegisterExpectedMemoryLeak. (Thanks to Michael Rabatscher.)
 - Added the Simplified Chinese translation of FastMM4Options.inc by
 QianYuan Wang. (Thank you!)
 - Included the updated C++ Builder files with support for BCB6 without
 update 4 applied. (Submitted by JiYuan Xie. Thanks!)
 - Fixed a compilation error under Delphi 5.
 - Made LogAllocatedBlocksToFile and ScanMemoryPoolForCorruptions thread
 safe - for real this time. (Thanks to Francois Piette.)
 Version 4.90 (9 September 2008):
 - Added logging of the thread ID when capturing and displaying stack
 traces. (Suggested by Allen Bauer and Mark Edington.)
 - Fixed a Delphi 5 compiler error under FullDebugMode. (Thanks to Maurizio
 Lotauro and Christian-W. Budde.)
 - Changed a default setting in FastMM4Options.inc: RawStackTraces is now
 off by default due to the high number of support requests I receive with
 regards to the false postives it may cause. I recommend compiling debug
 builds of applications with the "Stack Frames" option enabled.
 - Fixed a compilation error under Kylix. (Thanks to Werner Bochtler.)
 - Official support for Delphi 2009.
 Version 4.92 (25 November 2008):
 - Added the DisableLoggingOfMemoryDumps option under FullDebugMode. When
 this option is set, memory dumps will not be logged for memory leaks or
 errors. (Thanks to Patrick van Logchem.)
 - Exposed the class and string type detection code in the interface section
 for use in application code (if required). (Requested by Patrick van
 Logchem.)
 - Fixed a bug in SetMMLogFileName that could cause the log file name to be
 set incorrectly.
 - Added BCB4 support. (Thanks to Norbert Spiegel.)
 - Included the updated Czech translation by Rene Mihula.
 - When FastMM raises an error due to a freed block being modified, it now
 logs detail about which bytes in the block were modified.
 Version 4.94 (28 August 2009):
 - Added the DoNotInstallIfDLLMissing option that prevents FastMM from
 installing itself if the FastMM_FullDebugMode.dll library is not
 available. (Only applicable when FullDebugMode and LoadDebugDLLDynamically
 are both enabled.) This is useful when the same executable will be used for
 both debugging and deployment - when the debug support DLL is available
 FastMM will be installed in FullDebugMode, and otherwise the default memory
 manager will be used.
 - Added the FullDebugModeWhenDLLAvailable option that combines the
 FullDebugMode, LoadDebugDLLDynamically and DoNotInstallIfDLLMissing options.
 - Re-enabled RawStackTraces by default. The frame based stack traces (even
 when compiling with stack frames enabled) are generally too incomplete.
 - Improved the speed of large block operations under FullDebugMode: Since
 large blocks are never reused, there is no point in clearing them before
 and after use (so it does not do that anymore).
 - If an error occurs in FullDebugMode and FastMM is unable to append to the
 log file, it will attempt to write to a log file of the same name in the
 "My Documents" folder. This feature is helpful when the executable resides
 in a read-only location and the default log file, which is derived from the
 executable name, would thus not be writeable.
 - Added support for controlling the error log file location through an
 environment variable. If the 'FastMMLogFilePath' environment variable is
 set then any generated error logs will be written to the specified folder
 instead of the default location (which is the same folder as the
 application).
 - Improved the call instruction detection code in the FastMM_FullDebugMode
 library. (Thanks to the JCL team.)
 - Improved the string leak detection and reporting code. (Thanks to Uwe
 Schuster.)
 - New FullDebugMode feature: Whenever FreeMem or ReallocMem is called, FastMM
 will check that the block was actually allocated through the same FastMM
 instance. This is useful for tracking down memory manager sharing issues.
 - Compatible with Delphi 2010.
 Version 4.96 (31 August 2010):
 - Reduced the minimum block size to 4 bytes from the previous value of 12
 bytes (only applicable to 8 byte alignment). This reduces memory usage if
 the application allocates many blocks <= 4 bytes in size.
 - Added colour-coded change indication to the FastMM usage tracker, making
 it easier to spot changes in the memory usage grid. (Thanks to Murray
 McGowan.)
 - Added the SuppressFreeMemErrorsInsideException FullDebugMode option: If
 FastMM encounters a problem with a memory block inside the FullDebugMode
 FreeMem handler then an "invalid pointer operation" exception will usually
 be raised. If the FreeMem occurs while another exception is being handled
 (perhaps in the try.. finally code) then the original exception will be
 lost. With this option set FastMM will ignore errors inside FreeMem when an
 exception is being handled, thus allowing the original exception to
 propagate. This option is on by default. (Thanks to Michael Hieke.)
 - Fixed Windows 95 FullDebugMode support that was broken in 4.94. (Thanks to
 Richard Bradbrook.)
 - Fixed a bug affecting GetMemoryMap performance and accuracy of measurements
 above 2GB if a large address space is not enabled for the project. (Thanks
 to Michael Hieke.)
 - Added the FullDebugModeRegisterAllAllocsAsExpectedMemoryLeak boolean flag.
 When set, all allocations are automatically registered as expected memory
 leaks. Only available in FullDebugMode. (Thanks to Brian Cook.)
 - Compatible with Delphi XE.
 Version 4.97 (30 September 2010):
 - Fixed a crash bug (that crept in in 4.96) that may manifest itself when
 resizing a block to 4 bytes or less.
 - Added the UseSwitchToThread option. Set this option to call SwitchToThread
 instead of sitting in a "busy waiting" loop when a thread contention
 occurs. This is used in conjunction with the NeverSleepOnThreadContention
 option, and has no effect unless NeverSleepOnThreadContention is also
 defined. This option may improve performance with many CPU cores and/or
 threads of different priorities. Note that the SwitchToThread API call is
 only available on Windows 2000 and later. (Thanks to Zach Saw.)
 Version 4.98 (23 September 2011):
 - Added the FullDebugModeCallBacks define which adds support for memory
 manager event callbacks. This allows the application to be notified of
 memory allocations, frees and reallocations as they occur. (Thanks to
 Jeroen Pluimers.)
 - Added security options ClearMemoryBeforeReturningToOS and
 AlwaysClearFreedMemory to force the clearing of memory blocks after being
 freed. This could possibly provide some protection against information
 theft, but at a significant performance penalty. (Thanks to Andrey
 Sozonov.)
 - Shifted the code in the initialization section to a procedure
 RunInitializationCode. This allows the startup code to be called before
 InitUnits, which is required by some software protection tools.
 - Added support for Delphi XE2 (Windows 32-bit and Windows 64-bit platforms
 only).
 Version 4.99 (6 November 2011):
 - Fixed crashes in the 64-bit BASM codepath when more than 4GB of memory is
 allocated.
 - Fixed bad record alignment under 64-bit that affected performance.
 - Fixed compilation errors with some older compilers.
 Version 4.991 (3 September 2012)
 - Added the LogMemoryManagerStateToFile call. This call logs a summary of
 the memory manager state to file: The total allocated memory, overhead,
 efficiency, and a breakdown of allocated memory by class and string type.
 This call may be useful to catch objects that do not necessarily leak, but
 do linger longer than they should.
 - OS X support added by Sebastian Zierer
 - Compatible with Delphi XE3
